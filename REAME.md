# DobbyForge — The Autopilot Agent Builder for Sentient Chat

**DobbyForge** is an all-in-one generative agent creation suite for Sentient Chat. It takes any idea and delivers **ready-to-deploy, production-quality agents**—code, documentation, deployment, and all—built natively for the [Sentient Agent Framework](https://github.com/sentient-agi/Sentient-Agent-Framework).

---

## Why DobbyForge Wins

- **Complete Output:** Not just agent code, but documentation, deployment scripts, and prompt tuning.
- **No Friction:** Natural language interface—no config files or manual setup required.
- **Production-Ready:** All code is compliant with `AbstractAgent` from the Sentient Agent Framework.
- **Instant Deployment:** Generates Docker, GCP, and Railway configs for rapid launch.
- **Usage Telemetry:** Built-in hooks for tracking real-world adoption and performance.
- **Fast Iteration:** Ultra-fast prototyping and easy one-line updates post-launch.
- **Sharp Engineering:** Combines strong prompt engineering with modular, async Python code.

## What DobbyForge Delivers

**Input Example:**

> Build me a research assistant agent that summarizes PDF reports and searches open academic datasets.

**Output:**

- `agents/research_reader_agent.py` — Ready-to-run agent code
- `README.md` — Clear usage and deployment instructions
- `Dockerfile` — For local or cloud containerization
- `deploy/gcp_deploy.yaml` — GCP deployment config

All files are immediately usable and ready for Sentient.
